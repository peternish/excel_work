# Physics-Based Deep Learning

The following collection of materials targets _"Physics-Based Deep Learning"_
(PBDL), i.e., the field of methods with combinations of physical modeling and
deep learning (DL) techniques. Here, DL will typically refer to methods based
on artificial neural networks. The general direction of PBDL represents a very
active and quickly growing field of research. 

If you're interested in a comprehensive overview, please check our digital 
PBDL book: https://www.physicsbaseddeeplearning.org/ (or as PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2109.05237.pdf)

![An overview of categories of physics-based deep learning methods](resources/physics-based-deep-learning-overview.jpg)

Within this area, we can distinguish a variety of different physics-based
approaches, from targeting designs, constraints, combined methods, and
optimizations to applications. More specifically, all approaches either target
_forward_ simulations (predicting state or temporal evolution) or _inverse_
problems (e.g., obtaining a parametrization for a physical system from
observations). 
Apart from forward or inverse, the type of integration between learning
and physics gives a means for categorizing different methods:

- _Data-driven_: the data is produced by a physical system (real or simulated),
  but no further interaction exists. 

- _Loss-terms_: the physical dynamics (or parts thereof) are encoded in the
  loss function, typically in the form of differentiable operations. The
  learning process can repeatedly evaluate the loss, and usually receives
  gradients from a PDE-based formulation.

- _Interleaved_: the full physical simulation is interleaved and combined with
  an output from a deep neural network; this requires a fully differentiable
  simulator and represents the tightest coupling between the physical system and
  the learning process. Interleaved approaches are especially important for
  temporal evolutions, where they can yield an estimate of future behavior of the
  dynamics.

Thus, methods can be roughly categorized in terms of forward versus inverse
solve, and how tightly the physical model is integrated into the
optimization loop that trains the deep neural network. Here, especially approaches
that leverage _differentiable physics_ allow for very tight integration
of deep learning and numerical simulations.

This repository collects links to works on _deep learning algorithms for physics
problems_, with a particular emphasis on _fluid flow_, i.e., Navier-Stokes related
problems. It primarily collects links to the work of the I15 lab at TUM, as
well as miscellaneous works from other groups. This is by no means a complete
list, so let us know if you come across additional papers in this area. We
intentionally also focus on works from the _deep learning_ field, not machine
learning in general.
